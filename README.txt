Solar System MATLAB Project
Gudbrand Tandberg - gudbrandduff@gmail.com

The project consists of three m-files:

- Solarsystem.m, the entry point to the main program.
- gravity.m, helper-function that calculates gravitational acceleration.
- RK4.m, differential equation solver.

In addition, jpg images of all the planets are needed for running the program. 
System requirements: MATLAB 2010 or later. 

Enjoy
